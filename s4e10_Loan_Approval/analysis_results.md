## Quality Assessment

Based on 20 files - Based on the provided detailed summaries of the project files, here is a structured analysis addressing your four queries:

---

### 1. **Research topics identified**

- **Ensemble Learning / Stacking...

## Issues Encountered

- ⚠️ Enhanced analysis error for xgb_clean.py: unterminated string literal (detected at line 284) (<unknown>, line 284)
- ⚠️ Enhanced analysis error for knn.py: invalid syntax (<unknown>, line 140)

## Recommendations

### Code Quality Improvements
- Files with complexity > 10 should be refactored
- Files with maintainability index < 50 need attention
- Address any security issues flagged above

### Next Steps
- Review files with low quality scores
- Consider adding unit tests for complex functions
- Document any missing docstrings
